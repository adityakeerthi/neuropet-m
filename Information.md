# Informative Notes 

## NeuroPET-M Library
The compiled Cython code gets converted into a neuropetm.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so file, which can be publicly distributed amongst other OASIS-3 users. Furthermore, a Python script which orientates and supercedes the multiprocessing machine must also be distributed. Running this Python script will start the command-line interface with instructions accordingly. 

## Cython and Multiprocessing Optimization
Utilizing Cython and Multiprocessing has sped up the algorithm by 600%, making the runtime of the algorithm to be less than 5 minutes, depending on input sizes. 

## Operating System Limitations
The project was developed on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and is built for Unix Operating Systems. In the future, I plan on incorporating Windows compatability.

## Next Steps regarding Auto-Diagnosis
NeuroPET-M has a lot more work ahead, for example Auto-Diagnosis has not yet been implemented and will need to be implemented upon discussion with high end neuroscientists at local hospitals or other reputable firms. 

## Competitions
At the time of this update, NeuroPET-M has been submitted to Regeneron's International Science and Engineering Fair of 2021, and the Sanofi Biogenius Competition in Canada. This section will be updated accordingly.

## Authors
This piece of software (NeuroPET-M) has been created by Aditya Keerthi (15) and was inspired by his mentor Doctor Praveen Nekkar Rao.
